# SoHardToName
Built model on cycle time and payload. Generate optimal truck settings to maximize productivity.

# Results:
(1)Increase 22% of current tonnage; 

(2)Get optimal schedules with weights

## Model
GASolver.py:Use Genetic Algorithm to generate optimal solutions(schedule)

cost_estimation.py: Use physical theories to calculate truck's resistances, speeds, de/acceleration, 

main.py: Connect to Kibana & Elastic (test)

roadsegment.py:Extract road segments and related info

traverse cost.py: Plot
